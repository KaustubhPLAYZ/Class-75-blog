        <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attendif possible. </p>

        <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
          story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War', Black Panther, Age of
          ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the
          other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler
          alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed sci-fi
          series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore
          balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

        <p>2019’s The Lion King is a ‘live action’ remake of the 1994 original animation flick which went on to become
          an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King will vouch for its strong emotional
          connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a lasting impression and of course the legendary soundtrack
          and background score.

          So does the 2019 version of Lion King match up? (In India, the film is releasing in four languages – English
          and also dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.) The big draw of course of the Hindi dubbed version is actor Shah
          Rukh Khan as Mufasa and Aryan Khan as Simba. The father and son duo had earlier lent their voices to the Hindi
          dubbed version of The Incredibles in 2004.

          2019’s Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor. Everything you see on screen is etched out with
          spellbinding detailing and the visual finesse gives way to near perfection. Some scenes especially ones with
          the fire flies in the night, open starlit skies and expansive views of the forest look stunning. Where the
          visual appeal falls short is in the expressions and emotions on the faces, especially the eyes of the animals
          which the animated version had got so right. So while you do feel sad when Mufasa is killed, you are not
          particularly moved to tears like with the original. And while Scar looks evil, he is not menacing. Also though
          the film is thirty minutes lengthier it pretty much remains an almost scene by scene copy of the 1994 version,
          losing its potential to surprise and intrigue further.

          However, the principal voice cast is a delight – Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa is captivating from the word go,
          Aryan Khan shines as the young Simba – capturing every emotion perfectly. The scene where Simba speaks to his
          father’s reflection in the water, with Mufasa’s voice emanating from the sky stands out as a whole – visually
          and otherwise. Ashish Vidyarthi as Scar is particularly good, his voice adding the required dimension to the
          character.Perhaps to contextualize andgive it a local flavor Pumbaa (Sanjay Mishra) and Timon (Shreyas
          Talpade) speak in tapori hindi here – so there is a generous sprinkling of ‘Bhai’ ‘Jhakaas’ ‘ Apun’ ‘Bindass’.
          And the gang of hyenas speak in Bhojpuri.While it may connect with the audience and elucidate some laughs, it
          robs the classic film of some of its original flavor.

          Shreya Ghosal, Arman Malik and Sunayna Sarkar do a fine job with the Hindi renditions of the soundtrack. But
          for those who have reveled in the original 'Circle of Life', 'Can you feel the Love tonight' and 'Hakuna
          Matata' it may not match up totally. The background score by Hans Zimmer is one of the high points of the
          film.

          For those who haven’t seen the original, 'The Lion King' (2019) is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous
          visuals and technical genius and one’s catching it in Hindi will have Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan Khan adding
          their spark.</p>
